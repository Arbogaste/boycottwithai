# BoycottWithAI

## ⚠️ On AI & Human Review

**Most content here was generated by AI.** 
Our goal is to be useful fast, not polished forever. Here's what that means:

- Everything works, but can be better
- Every section needs human eyes—yours
- Inaccuracies or tone problems? Flag them. Improve them.
- Over time: more resources, more case studies, more real examples from real campaigns
- Your experience + corrections shape what this becomes

**Not waiting for perfect. Building toward useful.** If something here helps you fight for what you believe in, use it. If it needs work, tell us.

Tools and resources for people who care about peace, justice, and accountability. Built by activists and coders working together.

We use AI and code, but never as a substitute for human judgment. Every tool serves the people doing the hard work: researchers, activists, organizers, journalists. The technology is just scaffolding.

## Get started

**If you have 5 minutes:**
1. Pick a target (company, representative, decision you want to change)
2. Grab a template from `/public/templates/`
3. Make it yours—add your story, your evidence
4. Send it. Share it.

**If you have time to organize:**
1. Research using free data (ACLED, GDELT, local news)
2. Document what you find
3. Connect with others—your findings matter
4. Build pressure: petitions, letters, briefings, action

Real campaigns have won using these tools. You can too.

## Add your own cause or research

- Share your research—timeline, evidence, impact
- Add it as a resource so others can learn from your work

**Building a campaign?**

**More detailed:**
- Case studies go in `/public/downloads/resources/` (`.md` format, any language)
- Templates in `/public/templates/` (copy-paste ready, with clear instructions)
- UI text in `src/i18n/ui.ts` (translations help us reach more people)
- Page content in `src/pages/<lang>/` (your language, your perspective)

Every contribution teaches someone else how to organize, how to research, how to fight. That's the point.

## Key principles

- **Non-violent, lawful action only** — we emphasize diplomacy, transparency, and institutional pressure.
- **Evidence-based** — every claim links to sources (UN reports, satellite data, leaked documents, news archives).
- **Safe** — OSINT and monitoring resources protect sources and PII. Always follow local law.
- **Practical** — no theory-only content; templates are copy-paste ready.
- **Open & accessible** — code, resources, and data are freely shared. Community contributions shape priorities.

## AI & Automation Tools

This project integrates AI-assisted development and workflow automation:

**For campaign automation:**
- **Dataset creation & fine-tuning:** [SmashingLearning](https://github.com/Arbogaste/smashingLearning) — easy-dataset and LLaMA Factory for training models on campaign-specific data, terminology, and evidence patterns
- **Data validation:** Open-source tools for verifying OSINT claims, cross-checking sources, and deduplication
- **Sentiment analysis:** Detect propaganda narratives and escalation language in news feeds
- **Automated summaries:** Generate briefings from UN reports, NGO databases, and leaked documents

**Alternatives (if you prefer not to use closed-source services):**
- **LLaMA 2 / Mistral** — Open-source LLMs you can run locally
- **OLLAMA** — Easy local LLM deployment
- **Hugging Face datasets** — Community-curated datasets for training
- **Dolt** — Version-controlled databases for tracking changes in contracts, spending, and corporate records
- **Apache Airflow** — Workflow automation for data pipelines

**Safety first:** See the [Privacy & Security resource](/downloads/resources/privacy-security-tools-en.md) for how to use AI and automation tools safely in high-risk contexts. Never trust outputs without human verification—always fact-check and cite sources.
