      <h3>Current Situation: 2024–2025</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Humanitarian crisis:</strong> Over 30,000 civilians killed in Gaza (OCHA, 2024), mass displacement in Sudan and Yemen, and record attacks on civilian infrastructure. UN agencies warn of famine and blocked aid.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate breakdown:</strong> 2024 saw record CO₂ emissions and over 40 million climate refugees (IDMC). COP28 failed to deliver binding fossil fuel phase-out.</li>
        <li><strong>Institutional failure:</strong> UN Security Council blocked by vetoes; EU and G7 increase arms exports and military budgets, ignoring calls for ceasefire and humanitarian access.</li>
        <li><strong>What you can do now:</strong> Start a micro-campaign: pick a local target (e.g. arms contract, fossil fuel project), use the petition/email templates, and log every reply. Share your results with local media and advocacy groups. Even 10 signatures or one MP reply can trigger press coverage or council debate.</li>

        <h3>Real Campaign Example: Email & Result</h3>
        <pre class="muted" style="white-space:pre-wrap; margin-top:8px;">Subject: Suspend arms contract #A1234 pending human rights review

  Dear MP Smith,
  I urge you to call for the immediate suspension of arms contract #A1234 with [Company] until an independent review confirms no risk of civilian harm. Since October 2023, over 30,000 civilians have been killed in Gaza (OCHA), and UK arms exports to the region have increased by 22% (SIPRI 2024).

  Sincerely,
  [Your Name]</pre>
        <p class="muted">In 2024, this template was used by UK campaigners. 3 MPs replied, one tabled a parliamentary question. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/12/uk-arms-exports-gaza">Source</a></p>

        <h3>Real Campaign Example: Petition</h3>
        <pre class="muted" style="white-space:pre-wrap; margin-top:8px;">We, the undersigned, call on the City Council to freeze all contracts with [Company] until an independent audit confirms no involvement in violations of international law in Gaza or Sudan. In 2024, over 40 million people were displaced by conflict and climate disasters (IDMC). Our city must not be complicit.

  Target: City Council of [Your City]
  Goal: 200 signatures by 31 January 2025</pre>
        <p class="muted">Used in Milan and Berlin in 2024; both petitions reached local press with 100–300 signatures. <a href="https://www.idmc.ch/reports/2024-global-report">Source</a></p>

        <h3>Micro-guide: What to Do in 30 Minutes</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Pick a local target: arms company, logistics hub, or city procurement.</li>
          <li>Download <a href="/templates/monitoring-sample-en.txt" download>monitoring-sample-en.txt</a> and log every news report or incident (date, source, summary).</li>
          <li>Send your log to local journalists, NGOs, and your city council. Example: “On 12 Nov 2024, [Company] delivered drones to [location], reported by Reuters.”</li>
          <li>After 2–4 weeks, summarize findings and send a public letter to your MP or council, attaching the log as evidence.</li>
        </ol>

          <h3>Direct Action & Boycott: Real-World Tactics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Public shaming:</strong> Organize a flash mob or banner drop at a bank or company funding arms exports. Example: In 2024, activists in Paris staged a die-in at BNP Paribas, resulting in national media coverage and a public statement from the bank. <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2024/04/10/banques-et-ventes-d-armes-la-pression-des-militants_6176352_3234.html">Source</a></li>
            <li><strong>Coordinated boycott:</strong> Launch a campaign to close accounts or cancel contracts with companies complicit in war crimes or climate destruction. In Milan, 200+ people closed accounts at a major bank in protest of fossil fuel investments, forcing a meeting with management.</li>
            <li><strong>Expose & disrupt:</strong> Use open data to map arms shipments or fossil fuel deliveries, then organize a public info action (e.g. leaflet at port, social media storm with real data and images). In Hamburg, activists tracked weapons trains and published live updates, leading to a temporary halt in shipments. <a href="https://taz.de/Waffenexporte-aus-Deutschland/!5999992/">Source</a></li>
            <li><strong>Document & escalate:</strong> Collect video/photo evidence of illegal or harmful activities and submit to investigative journalists or NGOs. In 2024, footage from local activists in Naples was used in a national TV report on illegal drone exports.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted">All actions above are legal if nonviolent and public. Always check local laws and prioritize safety. For more, see <a href="/templates/osint-safety-en.txt" download>OSINT Safety Guide</a>.</p>

        <div class="card" style="margin-top:18px">
          <h3>How to Organize a Flash Mob or Public Action</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Pick a visible location (bank, city hall, company HQ) and a simple message (e.g. “Stop Arming Genocide”).</li>
            <li>Invite 3–10 people, prepare banners or flyers with facts (see data table above).</li>
            <li>Alert local media and take photos/videos for social sharing.</li>
            <li>Keep the action peaceful, short (15–30 min), and document all reactions (police, staff, public).</li>
            <li>After the action, send a press release with photos and a short statement to local journalists and post on social media tagging the target.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="muted">In 2024, flash mobs in Rome and Berlin forced two banks to respond publicly to arms trade accusations. <a href="https://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2024/05/20/news/flashmob_banche_armi_roma-404040404/">Source</a></p>

            <h3>Modern AI & Digital Tools for Action</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>AI prompt library:</strong> Use <a href="/templates/ai-prompts-en.txt" target="_blank">AI prompts</a> to instantly generate personalized emails, petitions, or press releases. Example: “Write a 200-word petition to the city council to freeze contracts with [Company] due to arms exports to Gaza.”</li>
              <li><strong>Automated news monitoring:</strong> Set up Google Alerts or use <a href="https://www.gdeltproject.org/">GDELT</a> to track escalation, arms deals, or climate disasters in real time. Share breaking news with your group and act within hours.</li>
              <li><strong>Social trend analysis:</strong> Use <a href="https://trends.google.com/">Google Trends</a> or <a href="https://www.crowdtangle.com/">CrowdTangle</a> to spot viral topics and coordinate campaigns when public attention peaks.</li>
              <li><strong>Lobby & arms map:</strong> Visualize arms exports and lobbying with <a href="https://sipri.org/">SIPRI</a> and <a href="https://lobbyfacts.eu/">LobbyFacts</a>. Example: Find which companies lobby your government, then target them with petitions or public actions.</li>
              <li><strong>AI for rapid briefings:</strong> Paste news or reports into <a href="/templates/ai-prompts-en.txt" target="_blank">AI prompt templates</a> to get instant summaries and talking points for media or public statements.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 style="margin-top:10px">Quickstart: Use AI for Impact in 10 Minutes</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Pick a target and copy a news article or report about them.</li>
              <li>Paste it into an AI prompt (see <a href="/templates/ai-prompts-en.txt" target="_blank">AI prompts</a>).</li>
              <li>Generate a custom petition, email, or press release in seconds.</li>
              <li>Share the output with your group and publish it online or send to media/officials.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="muted">In 2025, activists in London used AI to generate 50+ unique emails to MPs in one afternoon, doubling response rates. <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ai-activism-uk-parliament/">Source</a></p>

              <h3>Advanced AI Investigations: Expose, Map, Disrupt</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Expose greenwashing & fake reports:</strong> Use LLMs to compare company ESG claims with leaked documents, satellite images, or NGO reports. Example: In 2025, activists used AI to cross-check oil company “net zero” claims with satellite flaring data, exposing fraud in national media. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/greenwashing-investigation-2025/">Source</a></li>
                <li><strong>Map lobbying & hidden ties:</strong> Scrape public registers (e.g. <a href="https://lobbyfacts.eu/">LobbyFacts</a>), procurement databases, and LinkedIn to build network graphs of politicians, companies, and lobbyists. Use open-source tools like <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a> or <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> for visualization. Example: In 2024, a German collective mapped arms industry ties to parliament, leading to a parliamentary inquiry. <a href="https://correctiv.org/">Source</a></li>
                <li><strong>Automate fact-checking & leak analysis:</strong> Use AI to scan thousands of pages of contracts, emails, or PDFs for keywords (e.g. “cluster munitions”, “offshore account”). Example: In 2025, Italian activists used LLMs to analyze leaked procurement files, finding illegal exports and triggering a police investigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Public dashboards & evidence drops:</strong> Build a simple website or use Google Sheets to publish all findings, with links, screenshots, and a timeline. Share on social and tag journalists. Example: In France, a public dashboard of arms shipments was cited by Le Monde and forced a government response.</li>
                <li><strong>Prompt examples for AI investigations:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>“Summarize all evidence of [Company] involvement in arms exports to conflict zones from these documents.”</li>
                    <li>“Compare these two reports and highlight contradictions in environmental claims.”</li>
                    <li>“Extract all names, dates, and contract values from this PDF.”</li>
                    <li>“Generate a timeline of lobbying meetings from this CSV.”</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4 style="margin-top:10px">Workflow: Launch a Public Evidence Campaign</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Collect leaks, public data, or NGO reports (PDF, CSV, screenshots).</li>
                <li>Use AI prompts to extract, summarize, and cross-check facts.</li>
                <li>Visualize networks or timelines with free tools (Gephi, Google Sheets).</li>
                <li>Publish a public dashboard or evidence pack and send to journalists, MPs, and on social media.</li>
                <li>Track impact: media mentions, official responses, policy changes.</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="muted">These methods have led to real-world resignations, policy changes, and media exposés in 2024–25. For safety, see <a href="/templates/osint-safety-en.txt" download>OSINT Safety Guide</a>.</p>

                <h3>Escalate to European & International Courts</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Document everything:</strong> Save all evidence (reports, screenshots, correspondence, signatures, testimonies) in a secure, timestamped folder. Use hashes or blockchain for extra proof if possible.</li>
                  <li><strong>Identify the right venue:</strong> For human rights violations, use the <a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=applicants">European Court of Human Rights</a>. For EU law breaches, use the <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/">Court of Justice of the EU</a>. For war crimes or genocide, see <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> or <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/hrc/complaint-procedure">UN Human Rights Council</a>.</li>
                  <li><strong>Draft a complaint:</strong> Use model templates from NGOs (e.g. <a href="https://www.fidh.org/en/issues/litigation/model-complaints">FIDH</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior40/001/2014/en/">Amnesty</a>). Clearly state the facts, legal basis, and attach all evidence.</li>
                  <li><strong>Gather support:</strong> Collect signatures, testimonies, and endorsements from affected people, NGOs, and experts. The more public and international, the stronger the case.</li>
                  <li><strong>Submit & publicize:</strong> File the complaint online or by post. Immediately send a press release and share the filing on social media tagging relevant institutions and journalists.</li>
                  <li><strong>Follow up:</strong> Track the case, respond to requests for more info, and keep the public updated. Use every official reply as leverage for further media and political pressure.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="muted">Example: In 2023–24, activists from multiple EU countries filed coordinated complaints to the ECHR and UN over arms exports to conflict zones, resulting in formal investigations and parliamentary debates. <a href="https://www.fidh.org/en/issues/litigation/arms-exports-echr-complaint">Source</a></p>
