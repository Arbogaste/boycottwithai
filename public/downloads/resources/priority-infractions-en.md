# Priority Evidence Indicators for EU Infringement Procedures — EN

This document summarises twelve high-priority, highly actionable evidence indicators (2024–2026) that civil monitors can document and use to support infringement procedures. Each item lists the EU legal basis, why it is actionable, common evidence sources, and a short checklist for rapid collection.

---

## 1) SYSTEMIC PUBLIC PAYMENT DELAYS (Very High)

EU rule
- Directive 2011/7/EU — Late payments (maximum 30/60 days for public authorities)

Precedent
- Italy previously condemned (C-122/18) and other cases against Member States exist.

2024–2025 situation
- Systemic delays in health services, local authorities, and some PNRR contracting stations.

Documentable sources
- Public Commercial Credits platform (MEF), e-invoice dataset (issue date / payment date), Court of Accounts reports, regional open-data portals.

Why actionable
- Clear legal deadlines and prior ECJ decisions; demonstrate persistence and structural delay rather than isolated incidents.

---

## 2) DIRECT AWARDS & ARTIFICIAL FRAGMENTATION (Very High)

EU rule
- Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU — principles of competition, transparency, equal treatment

Precedent
- Multiple EU infringement cases (Italy, France, Spain) and ECJ rulings on artificial fragmentation.

2024–2025 situation
- Spike in below-threshold contracts, repeated micro-assignments to the same provider; effects of national procurement rules (e.g. D.lgs changes).

Documentable sources
- ANAC open contract data, municipal ‘albo pretorio’, repeated CIG / contractor IDs, contract award notices.

Why actionable
- Pattern-based: repeated fragmentation and repeat awards show a structured avoidance of competitive procedure.

---

## 3) LACK OF CONTRACT ROTATION / FIDUCIARY ASSIGNMENTS (High)

EU rule
- Procurement directives and Commission guidance on below-threshold procurement and competition

Precedent
- ECJ findings against disguised renewals or sham rotations.

2025 situation
- Same firms/consultants repeatedly engaged for IT, communications, PNRR support.

Documentable sources
- Public deliberations, attached CVs, historical procurement records from the same authority.

Why actionable
- Repetitive patterns and disguised renewals point to breach of equal treatment and competition principles.

---

## 4) CHRONIC ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURAL DELAYS (High)

EU rule
- Charter of Fundamental Rights: Art.41 (right to good administration) and Art.47 (effective remedy)

Precedent
- ECJ case law on judicial delays and administrative procedure standards extended to PA.

2025 situation
- Persistent excessive delays for building permits, environmental authorisations, energy permits beyond statutory terms.

Documentable sources
- PEC records, protocol timestamps, national/regional statutory deadlines, administrative registers.

Why actionable
- When delays systematically deny effective remedies or create de facto breaches of EU protections, Member State responsibility can be pursued.

---

## 5) PNRR DIGITALISATION NOT DELIVERED / FICTITIOUS DIGITALISATION (High)

EU rule
- PNRR regulations and the principle of effective use of EU recovery funds

Precedent
- Fund suspensions and recoveries for non-compliant use of EU funds in other Member States.

2025 situation
- Software procured but unused, duplicated platforms, disconnected systems lacking real logs or training evidence.

Documentable sources
- PNRR procurement notices, contract documentation, lack of user logs, absence of manuals or training records.

Why actionable
- EU may require recovery where funds are not used effectively or conditions of funding are unmet.

---

## 6) SYSTEMIC BREACHES OF ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT TIMELINES (VIA/VAS) (Very High)

EU rule
- Directive 2011/92/EU (EIA) and Directive 2001/42/EC (SEA)

Precedent
- Multiple ECJ cases; Italy previously condemned in similar contexts.

2025 situation
- EIA/SEA processes delayed or deadlines exceeded without formal suspension, affecting renewables and infrastructure projects.

Documentable sources
- Regional EIA portals, public deadline records, missing suspension acts.

Why actionable
- Procedural time limits are objective; systemic non-observance enables straightforward infringement claims.

---

## 7) FIDUCIARY ASSIGNMENTS MASKED AS URGENCY (Medium–High)

EU rule
- Emergency procurement derogations interpreted narrowly by ECJ; urgency cannot be structural

Precedent
- ECJ rulings limiting 'urgency' as ground for bypassing procurement

2025 situation
- "PNRR urgency" or similar formula used repeatedly to justify direct awards.

Documentable sources
- Determina a contrarre citing "urgency", repeated same-motive phrases, award notices.

Why actionable
- If 'urgency' is used routinely, not exceptional, it violates procurement rules and can prompt Commission action.

---

## 8) FAILURE TO TRANSPOSITION OR PARTIAL TRANSPOSITION OF DIRECTIVES (Very High)

EU rule
- Missed transposition obligations for directives (various files; see EUR-Lex deadlines)

Why actionable
- Mechanical breach: absence or partial transposition allows the Commission to open infringement procedures without prolonged factual inquiry.

Documentable sources
- EUR-Lex, national gazettes, parliamentary records and legislative texts.

---

## 9) STATE AID / MISUSE OF EU FUNDS (High)

EU rule
- TFEU Art.107 and related state aid rules; PNRR funding conditionality

Why actionable
- Misallocation or ineffective use of EU funds can be reviewed and subject to recovery or sanctions.

Documentable sources
- Funding agreements, PNRR monitoring pages, audit and recovery notices.

---

## 10) EXPORT CONTROL & ILLEGAL ARMS TRANSFERS (High)

EU rule
- Export-control regimes, sanctions and common positions on arms exports

Why actionable
- Evidenced transfers in breach of export rules or sanctions can lead to national and EU enforcement actions.

Documentable sources
- Export licence registers (when public), customs data, SIPRI and corporate disclosures.

---

## 11) FINANCIAL REPORTING & TAX ANOMALIES AFFECTING PROCUREMENT (Medium–High)

Why actionable
- Tax-avoidance structures, hidden payments and subcontracting can indicate procurement circumvention or illicit enrichment.

Documentable sources
- Corporate filings, beneficial-ownership registers, e-invoice trails and payment ledgers.

---

## 12) CONFLICT OF INTEREST & RELATED-PARTY CONTRACTS (Very High)

Why actionable
- Undisclosed related-party relationships and awards to connected entities breach transparency and equal treatment obligations.

Documentable sources
- Registers of interests, company ownership data, procurement dossiers and subcontractor chains.

Documentation & where to look (per issue)

1) Systemic public payment delays — where to find evidence
- MEF / Public finance portals: search for "Crediti Commerciali" or "Piattaforma Crediti Commerciali" on the Ministry of Economy site for aggregated payment delays and lists of creditors.
- E-invoice dataset (Agenzia delle Entrate / Sistema di Interscambio SDI): export invoice issue and payment dates to compute payment lags.
- Court of Auditors (Corte dei Conti) reports: search for public spending and payment delay reports for regions and sectors.
- Regional open-data portals (payments, suppliers): CSV exports with payment dates.

Checklist (evidence items)
- Exported CSV of invoices with issue date and payment date (source and download timestamp).
- Aggregated summary by year/sector showing average payment delay and % unpaid beyond 60 days.
- Official report or audit noting systemic non-payment (Corte dei Conti / regional reports).
- Any correspondence showing lack of corrective action or empty improvement plans.

2) Direct awards & artificial fragmentation — where to find evidence
- ANAC Open Data (contracts, awards): download CSVs listing CIG, awarding body, contractor, value and award type.
- Local 'albo pretorio' / procurement portals: search for award notices and 'affidamento diretto'.
- Contract award documents: look for identical object descriptions, repeated contractor IDs, repeated CIGs.

Checklist (evidence items)
- Table of repeated awards with same contractor/CIG and dates showing fragmentation under thresholds.
- Copies of award notices, determinations to contract, and procurement rules cited.
- Evidence of national rule changes (D.lgs. or local regulation) facilitating below-threshold awards.

Example: detect repeated CIGs (ANAC)

1. Download ANAC contract awards CSV (replace with the correct ANAC CSV URL):

```bash
curl -L -o anac.csv "<ANAC_CONTRACTS_CSV_URL>"
```

2. Use the helper script to detect repeated CIGs (stored at `scripts/extract_anac.py`):

```bash
python3 scripts/extract_anac.py --url "<ANAC_CONTRACTS_CSV_URL>" --out anac.csv --top 50
```

3. For each repeated CIG reported, download the corresponding award notices and determinations from the awarding body (albo pretorio / portal) and attach PDFs to your dossier.


3) Lack of contract rotation / fiduciary assignments — where to find evidence
- Public deliberations and award resolutions: download PDFs from municipal/regional websites.
- Attached CVs or contractor profiles included in procurement packages.
- Historical procurement records from the same authority (ANAC, municipal open data).

Checklist (evidence items)
- Chronological list of engagements showing same firm/person repeatedly retained.
- Copies of deliberations showing renewals or new 'assignments' with similar scope.
- Any internal rules or exceptions used to justify renewals.

4) Chronic administrative delays — where to find evidence

- Public complaints or case files where time exceeded statutory limits.

Checklist (evidence items)
- Export of protocol entries or PEC threads with received/sent timestamps demonstrating excessive delays.
- Reference to statutory time limits and calculation of exceeded days.
- Any communications from authority explaining delay (or absence of explanation).

5) PNRR digitalisation not delivered — where to find evidence
- PNRR procurement notices and contracts (official portals listing projects funded under Recovery and Resilience Facility).
- Project deliverables and progress reports submitted to the Ministry (if public) or summaries on MA/PA websites.
- Evidence of lack of system use: missing logs, absence of training records, no user manuals.

Checklist (evidence items)
- Procurement documentation showing software purchase and scope.
- Audit note or report demonstrating absence of usage logs or training.
- Screenshots or admin queries showing lack of user activity or system data.

6) Systemic EIA/SEA timeline breaches (VIA/VAS) — where to find evidence
- Regional EIA/VAS portals with published timelines and decision dates.
- Publicly available project files (dossiers) and published deadlines.
- Any official 'suspension' acts (if absent, note absence explicitly).

Checklist (evidence items)
- Timeline table for the project showing statutory deadlines and actual decision dates.
- Evidence of projects with expired deadlines without formal suspension acts.
- Copies of public notices and the project dossier indexed by date.

7) Fiduciary assignments masked as urgency — where to find evidence
