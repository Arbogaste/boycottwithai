# Non-violent Frameworks for High-risk Contexts (Iran / North Korea)

> Note: This document is for activists, journalists and diaspora communities seeking low-risk, non-violent methods to advance social justice where conventional protest carries extreme risk. Operational instructions that could cause harm or illegal activity have been removed or replaced with ethical alternatives.

## Purpose and scope
- Purpose: present verifiable, non-violent strategies to increase international pressure, document abuses, and build solidarity.
- Scope: we do not include instructions for sabotage, physical damage, or illegal actions; sharing or requesting such instructions can place people at severe risk.

## Guiding principles
- Put human safety first: minimize exposure and legal risk.
- Verifiability: label preliminary information clearly and verify claims whenever possible.
- Non-violence and ethical responsibility.
- Coordinate with trusted NGOs, journalists, and human rights defenders when possible.

## Thematic frameworks and safe alternatives
Below are themes inspired by the original material, reframed as safe, non-operational alternatives.

1) Economic pressure (ethical)
- Safe alternatives: documented, targeted boycott and divestment campaigns; transparency reports on supply chains linking state actors to abuses.
- Tools: corporate mapping, investor briefings, international petitions and consumer-awareness campaigns.

2) Information amplification instead of overload
- Safe alternatives: amplify verified reports, witness testimony and explainers to shape international public opinion.
- Tools: shareable dossiers for NGOs, journalist kits, hashtag campaigns focused on verifiable narratives.

3) Data integrity and responsible reporting
- Safe alternatives: improve data quality through verified testimony collection, open-data monitoring, and formal discrepancy reports to platforms.
- Tools: verification resources, templates for formal platform reports, collaboration with researchers.

4) Service accountability (instead of disruptive interference)
- Alternatives: advocacy for public service transparency, legal complaints about failures, and requests for audits.
- Tools: public complaint templates, audit requests, appeals to international oversight bodies.

5) Reputation and narrative work (ethical)
- Alternatives: factual campaigns that surface documented evidence, support for investigative journalism, and truthful consumer reviews.
- Tools: whistleblower toolkits, templates for submitting evidence to investigative outlets.

6) Satire and narrative framing
- Guidelines: satire can be effective but must avoid defamation, personal attacks, or coordinated fake accounts.
- Tools: safe satire templates and checks to ensure content is clearly satirical.

## Practical, low-risk actions
- Responsible documentation: save timestamps, source links and preserve originals while anonymizing vulnerable individuals.
- Partner with independent media and NGOs: share dossiers only with trusted partners.
- International advocacy: send concise briefs to foreign parliamentarians, NGOs, financial actors and international media.
- Strategic social use: amplify verified content; do not spread unverified claims or incite violence.

## Useful templates and checklists
- One-page brief for NGOs/journalists: context, key evidence, requested action.
- Diaspora/external advocacy templates (EXTERNAL ACTORS ONLY): use these to contact foreign parliamentarians, NGOs and international bodies. **Do not** use to contact local authorities or expose people on the ground.
- Source verification checklist: date, primary source, independent confirmations.

## Safety and privacy (high-level)
- Do not publish identifying details of people at risk without explicit consent.
- Use secure channels to share sensitive material with vetted partners.
- Consult organizations that provide legal support for advocacy activities.

## International collaboration and escalation
- Mobilize diaspora and foreign media to increase visibility.
- Pursue legal avenues, targeted sanctions campaigns, and corporate accountability measures.
