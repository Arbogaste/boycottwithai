# Content Safety Notice

The project repository contained a file named `stuff` with detailed operational instructions for sabotage, disruption, or other activities that could cause harm or illegal actions.

We will not publish, distribute, or integrate instructions that enable illegal or violent activities. Instead, this site provides:

- Ethical, non-violent campaigning methods.
- OSINT verification techniques and safety best practices.
- Multilingual prompt templates for research, summarization, translation, and safe counter-messaging.

If you have material that is intended for legal research, journalism, or harm-minimisation training, share it only with vetted partners and follow applicable laws and organizational policies. For assistance converting investigation notes into safe public briefings, use the `ethical-campaigning-guide-en.md` and the `ai-prompts-*.txt` templates as a starting point.
