# Ethical Campaigning & Civic Tech — Practical Guide

This guide presents non-violent, legal, and ethically-sound approaches to research, campaigning and public accountability. Harmful or illegal tactics are intentionally excluded. Use these methods to inform, document, and advocate.

## 1. Principles
- Respect the law and human safety.
- Prioritise truth, verification and source-safety.
- Minimise harm to bystanders and vulnerable groups.

## 2. Research & OSINT basics
- Verify sources: cross-check images, metadata and dates.
- Use reputable feeds (ACLED, GDELT, UN reports) and cite them.
- Preserve evidence: save originals, record timestamps, note URLs.

## 3. Secure workflows
- Use dedicated accounts, enable 2FA, prefer privacy-preserving tools.
- Share sensitive findings only with vetted partners and NGOs.

## 4. Campaign templates
- Petitions: state aim, target decision-maker, ask for measurable change.
- MP/contact emails: concise subject, 3 bullet points, clear call to action.
- Briefings: one-page summary, data appendix, sources list.

## 5. Ethical communications
- Aim for verifiable claims; label preliminary findings clearly.
- Use satire responsibly; avoid targeted harassment or defamation.

## 6. Measuring impact
