Subject: [Urgent] Prioritize diplomacy, humanitarian protection and oversight — [Your Town]

Dear [Representative's Name],

I am a constituent from [City/Town]. I'm writing to urge you to push for urgent diplomatic solutions and transparency measures to reduce the risk of escalation and to protect civilians.

Key points (tailor with local data):
- Evidence: [One short data point with source: e.g., "Country's military budget increased X% (SIPRI, YYYY)"]
- Risk: [Short risk line: e.g., "Increased transfers to company X correlate with rising civilian harm in region Y (ACLED)."]

Please support the following measures:
- Vote for or advocate for conditional export controls and public reporting on arms contracts and export licenses.
- Back immediate humanitarian funding and support for ceasefire negotiations.
- Support legislation that strengthens peace-building and reduces reliance on rapid military escalation.

Suggested follow-up: If possible, please publish a public statement supporting transparency and diplomacy, and consider a meeting with civil society groups working on de-escalation.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
[Your City/Country]
