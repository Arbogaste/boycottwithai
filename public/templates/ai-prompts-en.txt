AI Prompts: tailored prompts to power safe, factual civic messages and briefs

Below are suggested LLM prompts you can use to generate content, evidence synthesis, and personalized outreach. Always verify model outputs and cite primary sources.

1) One-page briefing (for journalists / partners)
"Create a concise one-page briefing for [country/region] covering: context, key evidence (with sources), political relevance, and 3 actionable asks. Include a two-paragraph outreach plan. Use neutral, evidence-first language and cite sources: SIPRI, ACLED, GDELT, UN reports where applicable. Keep length under 400 words."

2) MP Email personalization
"Given these facts: [paste 2-3 data points and links]. Write a short, respectful 3-paragraph MP email (subject line suggested) asking them to support transparency in arms exports, humanitarian funding, and diplomacy. Add a one-line ask for a public statement or meeting. Keep tone non-confrontational."

3) Petition summary
"Create a compelling 100-150 word petition summary for [country/city], citing 1-2 reliable sources (SIPRI/ACLED/UN) and include a clear call-to-action for signatures and MP outreach. Add 3 shareable social media messages (one tweet, one Facebook, one LinkedIn)."

4) Localized social media plan
"Given the campaign objective and 3 local data points, write a 7-day social media cadence with suggested post copy, hashtags, and visuals (text description). Prioritize non-violence messages and explanatory links to evidence." 

5) Evidence extraction
"From the following collection of reports, extract three key evidence points with dates and links and create a TL;DR for use in a briefing. List sources and provide a confidence score (High/Medium/Low) with short justification." 

6) Verification checklist (for volunteers)
"Given an uploaded image and metadata (time, location), produce a step-by-step verification plan: (1) geolocation steps, (2) reverse-image search, (3) cross-reference with ACLED/GDELT events, (4) how to flag and annotate in the project database." 

Notes: Always include primary source links in generated text and do not rely solely on the model's memory; validate with datasets and peer reviewers.

7) OSINT tools explained for non-technical readers
"Write a website section in plain, accessible English aimed at a general audience. Explain that the project uses a set of free and open-source tools to monitor conflicts, investigate arms transfers, detect disinformation, and analyze risks. For each of the following tools: SpiderFoot, Recon-ng, theHarvester, Maltego CE, Shodan, Metagoofil, Creepy, IntelOwl, Sublist3r, Censys, OSINT Framework, OSINT-SPY / OSINT-SH — include:
- Tool name
- What the tool does in simple terms
- Why it matters (what problem it helps to uncover, e.g., transparency, supply chain, disinformation)
- A short example scenario showing how a concerned citizen, journalist or researcher could use it safely.
Use a calm, non-technical tone, avoid jargon, and emphasize safety, legality and verification. End with a note that these are free/open-source tools and a reminder to prioritize privacy and non-harmful use."
