Suggested next steps (we will help):
1. Prepare a short cover letter describing the violation.
2. Attach the evidentiary package (CSV, photos, copies of acts).
3. Open a GitHub issue in the repository or email us at [contact address] with the package.
4. If immediate harm is present, notify local environmental authority and press office.

Notes on safety & verification:
- Use official sources (ARPA, ISPRA, regional portals, national gazette).
- Archive snapshots (Wayback or PDF) of pages that can change.
- If you are a whistleblower, do not include identifying material in uploads—contact us first for secure intake.
