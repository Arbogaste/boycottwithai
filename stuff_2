Africa

Below are the most current details, legal resources, and direct calls to action for your web app.

## 🏛️ Landmark Trials & 2026 Legal Status

### **1. TotalEnergies: The French Duty of Vigilance Trial**

* **Current Status:** **Live Hearings (Feb 19–20, 2026).** A historic trial is currently underway in Paris. For the first time, judges are deciding if a multinational can be legally forced to stop fossil fuel expansion (specifically targeting projects like EACOP in Uganda/Tanzania) to meet climate goals.
* **The Goal:** Plaintiffs (Sherpa, Friends of the Earth, and the City of Paris) are demanding a **37% reduction in oil production** by 2030.

### **2. Shell: The "Legacy Pollution" Victory**

* **Current Status:** **Upcoming Merits Trial (March 2027).** In June 2025, the UK High Court delivered a massive win for the Bille and Ogale communities, ruling that Shell PLC **can be held liable** for "legacy pollution" dating back decades, regardless of current ownership or "sabotage" claims.
* **Key Finding:** The judge ruled that failing to clean up an old oil spill is a **"continuous breach"** of law, allowing victims to sue years after the initial damage.

### **3. Glencore: Individual Accountability**

* **Current Status:** **Criminal Pleas (Nov 2025 – Feb 2026).** While Glencore paid $1.3B in corporate fines in 2022, the focus has shifted to its leaders. In late 2025, former top traders pleaded "not guilty" to bribery charges in West Africa. A full criminal trial is scheduled for **October 2027**.
